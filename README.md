# Mandarin
Mandarin is a package manager for the web, it delivers packages from https://scratch.mit.edu inside of a compact form with high performance. For certain packages, you can choose to either get a raw package (html) or get an embed that hotlinks back to the repository (Turbowarp).

# Where do you get your packages?
We get our embeds and packages from https://turbowarp.org, an open-source packager for scratch projects coming from https://scratch.mit.edu.

We grab the embeds from turbowarp and then package them up on our website for you to pick and choose from for your website.

# Can I use Mandarin for my Website?
Yes! You can use Mandarin to grab packages for your website. We request that you do put the proper credits though. (Mandarin, TurboWarp, and Original Creator of the Package, etc.)

# Is there only going to be Scratch Packages on here?
Currently, yes. In the future though, we have plans for external packages, but we will label them as such (NS).

# How do I navigate Mandarin?
To navigate Mandarin, go to the url and change /mandarin to /mandarin/pub.html, or use the gui on the website.

# Credits
Thank you to TurboWarp for packaging the games and providing proper embeds and packages.
